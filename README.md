## About

FoxIoT Wolf OS is a lightweight Linux firmware created for industrial IoT applications.

This repository is the build system that creates the Wolf OS firmware. Wolf OS itself is a custom embedded Linux system based on BusyBox, combined with FoxIoTâ€™s own boot system, networking stack, and core services to ensure robust operation.

While it is optimized for FoxIoT Wolf IIoT Gateways, it can also be adapted for use on other hardware.
