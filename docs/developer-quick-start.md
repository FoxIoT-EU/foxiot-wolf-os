This guide helps you quickly start working with your FoxIoT Wolf controller after installing the firmware.

## 1. Accessing the Controller

Once your controller is running, it will automatically try to obtain an IP address via DHCP.

To find the controller on your network:
- Check your router's DHCP client list.
- Use `arp-scan` to discover new devices:

```bash
# Find your network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0):
ip addr

# Scan your local network:
sudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet
```

Or use `nmap` if you prefer:

```bash
# Find your local subnet from your IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.123/24 â†’ subnet is 192.168.1.0/24)
# Then scan the network:
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

After finding the IP address, access it over SSH:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_CONTROLLER_IP
```

- Default user: `root`
- Default password: `foxiot`

The root password is managed through your project Makefile (located at `distro/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/Makefile`):

```make
PASSWORD = "foxiot"
```

> The root password is managed through your project Makefile (located at `distro/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/Makefile`):

> ```make
> PASSWORD = "foxiot"
> ```
>
> To change the root password, edit this line before building the firmware.
> 
> To **disable password login completely**, comment it out by adding a `#`:
>
> ```make
> # PASSWORD = "foxiot"
> ```
>
> It is highly recommended to disable root password login and rely only on SSH public key authentication for accessing the controller.


### Adding an SSH Public Key

For secure, passwordless login:

1. Create an SSH key on your computer (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519
   ```

2. Add your public key(s) to the firmware project before building:

   Use your preferred text editor to create or edit the file, and place one or more public keys into it:
   ```bash
   distro/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/root/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
   ```

> ðŸ’¡ You can add multiple public keys (one per line) if you want to allow access for several users.
> These keys will be automatically included into the firmware, allowing secure, passwordless access after flashing.

## 2. Compiling Your First Application

You will need to cross-compile your application for the controller's CPU architecture.

### Example: C Hello World Program

Create a simple C file:

```c
// hello.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello from Wolf Controller!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compile it for the target architecture (adjust your cross-compiler prefix accordingly):

```bash
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc hello.c -o hello_world
```

(You can later provide a full toolchain guide if needed.)

---

## 3. Uploading Your Application

Copy the compiled binary to the controller:

```bash
scp hello_world root@YOUR_CONTROLLER_IP:/root/
```

---

## 4. Running Your Application

SSH into the controller:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_CONTROLLER_IP
```

Make sure the binary is executable:

```bash
chmod +x /root/hello_world
```

Run it:

```bash
/root/hello_world
```

You should see:

```
Hello from Wolf Controller!
```
